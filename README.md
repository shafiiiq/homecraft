# Homecraft - The House Building Platform

**Jan 2024 - Mar 2024**

Discover a new way to build your dream home with our innovative platform. We connect you with skilled contractors ready to bring your vision to life. Simply share your building requirements—like land measurements, materials, and quality standards—and receive detailed proposals with cost estimates and quality guarantees.

You can easily compare and choose the best option that fits both your quality needs and budget.

One of our best features is our dedicated chat system for direct, instant communication with contractors. This goes beyond just messages—you can share detailed house plans and immersive 3D models. Our advanced AI tools also let you personalize and enhance these designs to match your unique style.

Our platform combines technology with ease of use. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is visually appealing and user-friendly. On the backend, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js ensure everything runs smoothly and can handle all your needs.

We also offer real estate services, allowing you to buy or sell land, buildings, houses, and rental properties—all in one place.

## Additional Features

1. **Project Timeline Tracker**: Keep track of your project's progress with a visual timeline that highlights key milestones and deadlines. Both you and your contractor can see real-time updates, keeping everything on schedule.

2. **Community Forum**: Connect with others in our community forum. Share your construction experiences, get tips and advice, and learn from others on similar journeys.

Experience the future of home construction and real estate with us, where your dreams meet expert craftsmanship and seamless technology.
